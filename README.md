# Linear Regression

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`linear_regression.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to perform linear regression using Python and the scikit-learn library. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more independent variables.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression.git

cd linear-regression

jupyter notebook

Open the linear_regression.ipynb notebook in your browser.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to learn about and run linear regression.

## Data
The notebook uses a sample dataset (data.csv) for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with your own dataset or use it as a starting point for your own linear regression projects.
